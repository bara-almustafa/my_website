# Active Directory (On-Perm)

**Delve into the methodologies for on-premises Active Directory (AD) penetration testing.** This resource outlines the full attack lifecycle targeting traditional, on-prem AD environmentsâ€”from reconnaissance and enumeration of domain assets to privilege escalation, lateral movement, and domain compromise. It focuses on real-world techniques such as Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, and exploitation of misconfigurations like unconstrained delegation. Designed for red teamers, penetration testers, and security professionals, this guide provides actionable insights into identifying and exploiting weaknesses within legacy and hybrid AD infrastructures, while offering defensive measures to mitigate risks.
